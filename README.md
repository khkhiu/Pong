# PONG
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

This is a simple pong game for the CS50's final project created using C# and unity. Game development was something that I have always wanted to try and CS50 gave me the perferct opportunity for me to explore the field. Pong was choosen as it is a simple game that I felt could be created relatively quickly. Furthermore, pong would bring my CS50 experience full-circle as I had created a pong game in Week 0 using Scratch.

Players will be greeted with a simple 'Start' screen when launching the game. The game will immediately start when 'Start Game' is choosen. Players use either the 'W' and 'S' keys or the arrow keys to control their paddles. The 'R' key will reset the scores and position of all assets in the game. The 'Q' key is used to pause the game. The 'ESC' key is used to quit the application. The first player to reach a score of 5 will win the game.
